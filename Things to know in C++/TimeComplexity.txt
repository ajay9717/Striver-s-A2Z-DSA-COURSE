Time Complexity :- The rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size.
Big Oh notation :-
O(Time taken)
-> Worst Case Scenario.
-> Avoid Constants.
-> Avoid lower Values.
-> Upper bound.


Big theta notation:-
-> Best Case Complexity.
-> Lower bound.

Big Omega notation:-
-> Average case Complexity
-> Average bound or middle bound.


Space Complexity:-
-> Memory Space.
-> Big Oh notation.
-> Auxiliary Space(Space that you take to solve the problem) + Input Space(The space that you take to store the input).
